                    Collecting Bottles on Web (ColB) is a handy tool constructed using web technologies.
                    Created due to the lack of a platform for those with a passion for containers (yes, oddly specific, we know).
                    Due to large range of content that can be provided by its users, it is an enjoyable tool to have.

                    Collecting Bottles on Web is a tool that we have created as our project for Web Technologies, the capabilities of the website are the following :
                </p>

                        <li>
                            Search for items & filter posts based on tags with checkboxes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each user has their own inventory table with categories, sub-categories and items
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A logged-in user can create posts with their containers and their desired details
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A user can select one (maybe more items) to share by the click of a button

                            An admin can connect to their account and they have the same features as a normal user, aside of some extra ones :

                    We chose this project to challenge ourselves, to discover what it takes to make such a specific tool considering the absence of such a concept.
                    A application so similar to the concepts of the well known social media and classified advertisement platforms and yet so different.

However, there is a small trick to this simple welcome, on access we also compile <a href="../php/createTables.php">this php file</a>, which signals the host to check for any missing tables within its database, if there are any missing they will automatically be created, thus making the webapp very easy to change host machines.

                    <p>
                        Aside of this webpage, all webpages that need any access to the database - include / import a simple php <a href="../php/connectDB.php">file</a>, that does just that (creates a temporary connection).

                        The menu and profile shortcuts are on most pages, designed via <a href="../css/menus.css">this css</a> in which every button is customized, each icon is set towards a specific size, each button having it's own desired parameters. The animation of the other sub-buttons are done using <a href="../js/menus.js">this js</a>, however the each main button has it's own twin. Once you click on a main button, it executes the animation and also sneakily changes its place with its twin (via a z-index), the twin does a reverse animation on click and once again changes place.

                    <img src="../resources/scholarly/signup1.png" alt="ScholarlySignUp1" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <img src="../resources/scholarly/signup2.png" alt="ScholarlySignUp2" style="width:100%; height:100%;">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The sign-up page is mostly made of the sign up form, its elements (from the text boxes and icons, to the writing and slide bar) are designed via <a href="../css/signup.css">this css</a>. The emails and passwords are evaluated in real time, the passwords are hidden or shown (via *** characters) at the press of a button configured using <a href="../js/signup.js">this js</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside of the elements seen in the given pictures, there are a lot of things going on in the background. Due to some complications with sending the form data, all the checks (matching passwords / emails), non-empty fields and fields containing character specifics (such as having a @ followed by .com, or having a minimum of x characters - while having at least 1 special, 1 digit, etc), are all checked in the same javascript file using several functions and regexes, alerting the user of whatever issues there are (all the issues that are within the case at once, so the user doesn't need to guess).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the form details are acceptable they are also parsed using <a href="../php/signup.php">this php</a>, where the username and email are first checked to see if there are any identical ones present in the database, if so the user is alerted and they can reintroduce once more the details. If not, then the user is welcomed with a successful account creation and redirected to the login page.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Similarly to the sign-up page, its elements are designed via <a href="../css/login.css">this css</a> and a much simpler javascript <a href="../js/login.js">file</a> is used to hide and unhide the password, a difference being the addition of a few buttons.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                       However, unlike it's javascript file, the php <a href="../php/login.php">file</a> is far more complex. Here once again there are checks made with the database and a few conveniences are in place (for example the "username" to login can either be the created username or email). But there is an issue in comparison to the signup, yes we do send a successful login message and redirect the user, however how do we know how to access automatically further user data without constantly asking for the login details?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well we implement a cookie that remembers the user's id, the cookie is removed after 24h, or it is modified / renewed through a same / different login. Once a user wants to connect to a different account we check for a existing cookie, if there is one, we give it the time of 0, afterwards we remember the new cookie with the respective id, thus making everything seemless for the user.

                    <p>
                        These 2 twin webpages are pretty self-explanatory, designed via this <a href="../css/forgotUser.css">css</a> and this <a href="../css/forgotPass.css">css</a>, so simple and yet there is much more behind the scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On submission each webpage compiles a php file that helps recover the <a href="../php/forgotUser.php">user</a> or the <a href="../php/forgotPass.php">password</a>. Once the email is entered the data is sent to the respective php file, which then checks for any username / password associated to the email within the database, if there is none, then the user will be prompted a invalid email address message. However, if the email is valid, then the host automatically sends a email to the given address containing the requested information, afterwards redirecting the user to the login page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The host has its own email address dedicated to such issues configured a smtp, for example if you are using Xampp you must configure the "php.ini" and "sendmail.ini" files. If you want to use a Google account for this then you have to secure and configure your Google account, as well as using a one time password (this can no longer be done easily through a simple option of allowing 3rd party apps to your account - feature removed on the 20th of May 2022).

                    <p>
                        Once the user logs in they are redirected to this webpage, where they can insert whatever profile details they'd like, these details afterwards being used in their posts and inventory, thus reducing the chances of spam / fraudulent posts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the user confirms the given details they will be automatically update the table below, showing the user a preview of the data, if they dislike it or a mistake was made, they can enter and submit new details.

                        As usual, the webpage is designed via a <a href="../css/profile.css">css</a>, however this time, since we need real time data to show, the webpage and the information requests are implemented at once in one <a href="../php/profile.php">php</a>, the submission of the introduced information are done via a different <a href="../php/profileR.php">php</a>.

                        This is a more informative webpage, as usual, designed using a <a href="../css/aboutUS.css">css</a>. This webpage has also a few perks, any user logged in or not can check these details and send a contact form, the difference in between logged in and non-logged in users being that for logged in users the Name and Email are automatically extracted from the database.

                    <p>
                        Similarly to the forgotten details pages, it uses a smtp to send the details, the information being parsed via a php <a href="../php/aboutUs.php">file</a> where the given information is rewritten in a different format so that the ColB team can easily understand from whom the email is and what is that they want to communicate.

                     Working on this project, creating a web application from nothing all the way to what it is now allowed us to gain a large amount of knowledge and to appreciate the hard work of professional web developers. Even if our project is not yet finished and there could always be place for improvement, we're glad that we did this.
